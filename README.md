# Arduino-arbitrary-function-R2R-DAC-generater
Use port manipulation on Arduino Uno/Mega to output any 8 bit waveform. The python script generates the C code for arduino IDE.


go here to run the code maker https://repl.it/repls/BraveVengefulFeed

Google "arduino mega 2560 port" for port code/pinmap.

You will to make your own R2R DAC thing hopefully with a lowpass filter
